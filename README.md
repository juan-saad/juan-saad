Hi there 👋

I'm Juan Manuel, a Software Developer with a growing focus on Solution Architecture area. Here's a bit more about me:

- 🔭 I'm currently working with Azure as my primary cloud platform, while also gaining hands-on experience with AWS. I use Terraform daily to manage infrastructure as code and streamline deployment processes.
- 🌱 I'm constantly expanding my knowledge in cloud architecture, automation, and building scalable, secure systems.
- 👯 I'm eager to collaborate on cloud-native solutions, AI projects, and designing robust backend systems that scale efficiently.
- 🏊‍♂️ When I'm not coding, I'm swimming—it keeps me active and energized!
