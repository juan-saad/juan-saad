Hi there 👋

I'm Juan Manuel, a Software Developer with a growing focus on Solution Architecture area. Here's a bit more about me:

- 🔭 I'm currently working with **Azure** and **AWS** as my primary cloud platform. I use Terraform daily to manage infrastructure as code and streamline deployment processes.
- 🌱 I’m constantly expanding my knowledge in **cloud architecture**, automation, and building scalable, secure systems. I also focus on **dotnet** for backend development and **Angular** for front-end applications.
- 👯 I'm eager to collaborate on cloud-native solutions, AI projects, and designing robust backend systems that scale efficiently.
- 🏊‍♂️ When I'm not coding, I'm swimming—it keeps me active and energized!
